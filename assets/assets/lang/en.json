  "aboutMe": "As a developer multiplatform focusing on Flutter and Laravel, I have been exploring the world of programming since 2019. I view coding as a form of creative art 🎨 that allows me to build innovative and impactful digital solutions.\n\nIn 2022, I began my professional journey as a Flutter developer 🚀, gaining valuable experience through an internship at RS Citra Husada Jember, followed by a position at PT Andalan Solusi Cemerlang. Currently, I work as a Fullstack Developer at neTurmeric since January 2025, contributing to both frontend and backend application development.\n\nI’m deeply impressed by Flutter's ability to create stunning cross-platform applications from a single codebase 💡. This framework enables development for Android, iOS, web, Windows, macOS, Linux, and even embedded devices 🌍. To complement my frontend skills, I also specialize in backend development using Laravel, a powerful framework for building efficient and secure web applications 🔒.\n\nMy main goal is to deliver the best user experience through intuitive and responsive design ✨. Beyond that, I am always excited to learn new technologies 📚, stay updated with industry trends, and build effective communication 🤝. I’m committed to creating innovative solutions that make a real impact 💪.\n\nTo share knowledge and inspire others, I started documenting my projects on Instagram 📸. Although still in its early stages, I believe in continuous learning and growth 🔄.\n\nI’m enthusiastic about collaborating on new projects and creating something amazing together! 🚀💻🎉",
